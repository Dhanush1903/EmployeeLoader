git --version


Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information
git config --global user.name "w3schools-test"
git config --global user.email "test@w3schools.com"
Note: Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.
If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global


To remove global user
git config --global --unset user.name
git config --global --unset user.email


initialize Git
git init


git status


To add files to staging
git add --all

Git considers each commit change point or "save point".When we commit, we should always include a message.
git commit -m "first release"

To view the history of commits for a repository, you can use the log command:
git log

This will display a very long list of commands
git help --all

new git branch
git branch hello-world

Let's confirm that we have created a new branch
git branch

checkout is the command used to check out a branch. Moving us from the current branch, to the one specified at the end of the command:
git checkout hello-world

to merge branches first revert to master 
git checkout master

git merge hello-world

delete branch
git branch -d hello-world


connecting to github
create a repo 

git remote add origin https://github.com/Dhanush1903/EmployeeLoader.git

Now we are going to push our master branch to the origin url, and set it as the default remote branch:
git push --set-upstream origin master


To disconnect from remote repository
git remote remove origin


fetch gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.
git fetch origin

We are behind the origin/master by 1 commit. That should be the updated README.md, but lets double check by viewing the log:
git log origin/master


That looks as expected, but we can also verify by showing the differences between our local master and origin/master:
git diff origin/master

merge combines the current branch, with a specified branch
git merge origin/master


But what if you just want to update your local repository, without going through all those steps?
pull is a combination of fetch and merge. It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on.

git pull origin
